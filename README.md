## HyFlow

HyFlow is a Distributed Transactional Memory (DTM) framework written 
in Java. It is a work-in-progress research project, and thus it 
is not stable nor meant for any kind of production environment. 

Our website is at [hyflow.org](http://www.hyflow.org/). It contains
a Getting Started guide that will help you install the pre-requisites
needed by HyFlow, build it, and finally run our distributed
benchmarks.

### Saying hello
The Distributed Transactional Memory research community is fairly
small. It would help us know who is involved with DTM research, 
or otherwise has an interest in DTM. By downloading HyFlow, you
certainly have such interest. If you use HyFlow in your work, or even
just download it for tests, we kindly ask you to let us know. Please
e-mail the [current maintainer](http://www.hyflow.org/hyflow/wiki/Team)
and say hello. Alternatively, we can also be reached on 
[the dtm-research group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dtm-research)
on Google. If you are a researcher or student interested in DTM, please
consider joining this group.
