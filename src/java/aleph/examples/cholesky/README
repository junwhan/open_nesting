1.Function of the program:

    This program performs the cholesky factorization of a sparse symmetric
positive-definite matrix: A = L*Lt. It is used as a benchmark of the Aleph
Toolkit.

2.How to run the program:

    There is one command-line argument for this program: the inputfile name.
A typical command to run this program would be like:
   
       "java aleph.Aleph aleph.work.Cholesky input-file-name"

    The input matrix(A) should be stored in a file in the following format:
       Line 1: dimension-of-matrix number-of-nonzero
       Rest Lines: row column value-of-element
         All nonzero elements must be put into the input file, though matrix
       is symmetric.

    Upon loading in the data, program will factor the matrix, store result
into a corresponding ".res" file, and report the performance at the same
time.
