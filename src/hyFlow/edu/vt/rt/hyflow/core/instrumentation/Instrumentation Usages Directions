HYFLOW Instrumentation is based on DEUCE Instrumentation Engine. The atomic access to memory is provide using "Atomic" annotation 
through basic implementation of DEUCE.

To access the object remotely in any function user should use "Remote" Annotation.

To make any function immune to instrumentation user should use "Resolute" Annotation.

To specify the class for which needs to move around and used remotely, use should use "Mobile" Annotation.

Any method which is not annotated is duplicated by Deuce and called with extra argument named context to provide atomicity.

Use "bytecodePrint" flag in default.conf file to print and debug the generated bytecode.

TODO List: For next Release
Remove the Dummy Class Requirement, Use ClassLoader
Support Constructor & Atomic or Constructor & Remote simultaneously
Reduce code complexity
